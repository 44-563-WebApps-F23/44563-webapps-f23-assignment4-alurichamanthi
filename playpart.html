    <h1>Hello, I am Chamanthi Aluri</h1>
    <p>I am excited to announce that I will be performing in a play!</p>

    <h2>A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen</h2>

            
  <p class="direction">(SCENE.—The editorial office of the "People's Messenger." The entrance
door is on the left-hand side of the back wall; on the right-hand side
is another door with glass panels through which the printing room can
be seen. Another door in the right-hand wall. In the middle of the room
is a large table covered with papers, newspapers and books. In the
foreground on the left a window, before which stands a desk and a high
stool. There are a couple of easy chairs by the table, and other chairs
standing along the wall. The room is dingy and uncomfortable; the
furniture is old, the chairs stained and torn. In the printing room the
compositors are seen at work, and a printer is working a handpress.
HOVSTAD is sitting at the desk, writing. BILLING comes in from the
right with DR. STOCKMANN'S manuscript in his hand.)</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>        
        <p>Well, I must say!</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>
        <p class="direction">(still writing)</p>
        <p>Have you read it through?</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>
        <p class="direction">(laying the MS. on the desk)</p>
        <p>Yes, indeed I have.</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p>Don't you think the Doctor hits them pretty hard?</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>        
        <p>Hard? Bless my soul, he's crushing! Every word falls like—how shall I put it?—like the blow of a sledgehammer.</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p>Yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the first blow.</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>        
        <p>That is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. As I sat in there reading this, I almost seemed to see a revolution in being.</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p class="direction">(laying the MS. on the desk)</p>
        <p>Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>
        <p class="direction"> (lowering his voice)</p>
        <p>Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
          coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
          insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p>Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>        
        <p>That will be the devil of a nuisance.</p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p>Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
          whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
          project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
          the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
          in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
          in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—</p>

        <p class="speech Billing"><strong>Billing:</strong></p>        
        <p>Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
          penny—       </p>

        <p class="speech Hovstad"><strong>Hovstad:</strong></p>        
        <p>Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
          be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
          enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
          another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
          the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
          the Liberals.</p>
